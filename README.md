# üè• HealthDB SQL Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing healthcare data using SQL. The database `healthdb` contains information about **patients**, **doctors**, **appointments**, **prescriptions**, and **billing records**. Through various SQL queries, the project aims to provide insights into hospital operations, doctor performance, patient behavior, and financial trends.

## üîç Analysis Performed

1. **Patient-Specific Appointments and Prescriptions**

   * Retrieve all appointments or prescriptions linked to a specific patient or appointment ID.
   * Helps in tracking patient history and treatment progress.

2. **Billing and Payment Insights**

   * Analyze billing information per appointment and identify **paid** and **pending** payments.
   * Calculate **total billed amount** vs **total paid amount** to measure revenue flow.

3. **Appointments Overview**

   * Join data from `patients`, `doctors`, and `billing` tables to view full appointment details with billing status.
   * Analyze appointment distribution by **doctor specialty** and **appointment reason** to identify high-demand areas.

4. **Doctor Performance Metrics**

   * Count the number of appointments per doctor.
   * Identify doctors generating the **highest total billed amount**.
   * Track doctor activity over time (e.g., appointments in August or recent months).

5. **Patient Analysis**

   * List patients with their **latest appointment date**.
   * Identify patients who have **no appointments** or **unpaid bills**.
   * Filter patients who visited in the **last 30 or 90 days** to understand engagement trends.

6. **Prescription Analysis**

   * Find the **most frequently prescribed medications** and their **total dosage**.
   * Retrieve prescriptions linked with **pending billing** to monitor unpaid treatments.

7. **Demographic Analysis**

   * Analyze patient demographics by gender distribution.
   * Understand the hospital‚Äôs patient base composition for better service planning.

8. **Financial and Time-Based Trends**

   * Study **monthly payment status trends** to observe payment behaviors over time.
   * Calculate **average billing per patient** based on appointment frequency.
   * Analyze unpaid bills and revenue gaps using status and total amount comparisons.

9. **Data Integrity Checks**

   * Identify **appointments without billing** and **patients without appointments** to ensure data completeness.
   * Convert appointment date from text to date format for accurate time-based filtering.

10. **Monthly and Day-Wise Analysis**

    * Retrieve appointments and payments for a specific month (e.g., August 2025).
    * Count total appointments per day to track hospital workload.
